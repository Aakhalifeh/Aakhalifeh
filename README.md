## Hello, I'm Amer Khalifeh!
- I'm a 15 year old sophomore at **ACS**, and I'm a Manchester United Fan, although let's be honest with ourselves, Messi is the **GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME!**

- I've been a boxer for 7 months, I absolutely love playing the sport, and my aim is to become a Olympic-level world champion. I have a very controversial take on Boxing, as I believe, "Iron" Mike Tyson, is a superior boxer to Muhammad Ali!

- The greatest moment I had seen with my own two eyes, When **LIONEL ANDRES MESSI** won the 2022 World Cup, a fairytale ending. [I'm an in-line style link](https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022)
